# FunctionalFrontendForm
 A form made using vanilla js. no backend. no server. can save the form to a file on computer, and select the file later on to continue work.  Has CRUD functionality with no backend. 
 I wanted a way to create a file that would be in json that way I can manually upload to sql server. Have server that takes a while to display forms that I work with everyday to fill out information about clients. So this way I can work on as much data as I want at once, and send it all to the server at the end of the day.
 This is not mobile friendly. No longer working on this.
