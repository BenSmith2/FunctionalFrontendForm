# FunctionalFrontendForm
 A form made using vanilla js. no backend. no server. This app writes to a file that then is downloaded. Then can read those files and populate the data back on to the page. 
Why I made it: I had to fill out the same form multiple(15-30) times a day, but waiting for the webserver and the DB query each time I submitted the form was taking way to long. I discovered that the DB had an API that would allow me to send a JSON formatted string to it or a CSV, that it would then process the string, and put the data into the DB for me. That would just be one query instead of many, and no more waiting on the webserver each time I needed the form. So, I created this client side app that will allow me to fill out the form as many times as I need to, and submit the file to the API to then only run a query once. The forms needed validations to meet the requirements of the DB's data models it used to normalize data, this app has that too.  This is the demo product. Thank you for checking it out.
